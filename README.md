# mc2
A work-in-progress Minecraft clone. Uses the [Sanity](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1243771-alvorias-sanity-1-12-2-christmas-add-on-pack-is) texture pack.

Disclaimer: As mentioned above, this is a work-in-progress. It has many bugs and missing features.

Controls should be more-or-less the same as actual Minecraft.

Libraries:
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [NoiseJS](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
